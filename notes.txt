Create a demonstration of Responsive Design using a simple series of containers. 

Use media queries to change the background color and the arrangement of the containers as the width of the browser changes.

Small, default styles		#e61313		400px;

Medium, above 480px			#ebac15		480px;
Large, above 768px 			#7feb15		768px;
Maximum, above 1024px		#1561eb		1024px;

Content and image assets, as well as our in-class demo, are here: https://github.com/greglunn/responsivedemo.

Build Mobile Firstâ„¢. Start with the smallest size styles, and use min-width @media queries to alter the styles as the page gets wider.

Use Git to commit your work, and push to a repository called "responsivedemo" on GitHub.
